# Charter Development Comment Tracking

Github comment tracking is used througout the OCF Collab consensus process.  Concensus, as defined in the T3N2 Guidelines, requires that OCFC Chairs and Facilitators publicly record all issues raised as a Github issue with an attached Github Discussion. A consensus **cannot be declared by the Facilitator or Chair** if any open issues on the subject matter of the consensus decision remain open.
